# Agent KakaoTalk

A TypeScript CLI tool that enables AI agents and humans to interact with KakaoTalk through a simple command interface. Features sub-device login that keeps your desktop app running.

## Key Concepts

Before diving in, a few things about KakaoTalk's architecture:

- **LOCO protocol** = KakaoTalk's binary messaging protocol. The CLI handles this internally — you never interact with it directly.
- **Chat rooms** = conversations (1:1, group, or open chat). Referenced by numeric chat ID.
- **Device slots** = KakaoTalk allows one phone + one PC + one tablet session. The CLI registers as a **tablet** by default to avoid kicking your desktop app.
- **Sub-device** = a secondary device (PC or tablet). The CLI logs in as a sub-device, so your phone session is never affected.
- **Passcode verification** = when registering a new device, KakaoTalk displays a code on screen that you confirm on your phone.
- **Log ID** = a unique numeric identifier for each message, used for pagination.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Login (registers as sub-device, desktop app stays running)
agent-kakaotalk auth login

# List chat rooms
agent-kakaotalk chat list

# Send a message
agent-kakaotalk message send <chat-id> "Hello from AI agent!"

# List messages in a chat
agent-kakaotalk message list <chat-id>

# Show your identity
agent-kakaotalk whoami
```

## Authentication

Registers the CLI as a sub-device (tablet slot by default). Your desktop app keeps running.

```bash
agent-kakaotalk auth login
```

In interactive mode, this prompts for email and password. On macOS and Windows, the CLI first tries to extract cached credentials from the desktop app so you may not need to type anything. On Linux there is no desktop app, so always pass credentials explicitly via `--email` and `--password` (or `--password-file`).

For AI agents (non-interactive), provide credentials via flags:

```bash
agent-kakaotalk auth login --email user@example.com --password mypass
```

**Device registration flow**: On first login, KakaoTalk requires device verification:
1. The CLI requests a passcode from KakaoTalk's server
2. A numeric code is displayed — enter it on your phone when prompted
3. The CLI polls until you confirm on your phone
4. Login completes automatically after confirmation

**IMPORTANT**: NEVER guide the user to open a web browser, use DevTools, or manually copy tokens. Always use `agent-kakaotalk auth login`.

### Agent Behavior (MANDATORY)

When a command fails because no account is configured, the agent MUST drive the auth flow itself:

**Step 1: Check auth status**

```bash
agent-kakaotalk auth status
```

If authenticated → retry the original command.

**Step 2: Login (registers as sub-device — desktop app stays running)**

```bash
agent-kakaotalk auth login
```

The CLI auto-extracts the email (and password if available) from the desktop app. On fresh installs, the CLI may prompt for the KakaoTalk password once (one-time device registration). After registration, the password is never needed again.

Possible responses:

- `{"authenticated": true, ...}` → Success. Retry original command.
- `{"next_action": "confirm_on_phone", "passcode": "1234", ...}` → Tell the user to enter the displayed code on their phone. The CLI is polling — wait for it to complete, then the login will finish automatically.
- `{"next_action": "choose_device", ...}` → Tablet slot is occupied. Ask user which slot to use, then re-run with `--device-type pc --force` or `--device-type tablet --force`.
- `{"error": "bad_credentials", ...}` → Wrong email or password. Ask the user to provide their credentials manually via `--email` and `--password` flags.
- `{"next_action": "run_interactive", ...}` → One-time device registration. On macOS/Windows, the CLI normally shows a native password dialog automatically. This response only appears in headless environments where no GUI or TTY is available. Ask the user to run `agent-kakaotalk auth login` in any terminal. Do **NOT** ask for the password in chat.

Alternatively, use `--password-file`:

```bash
agent-kakaotalk auth login --password-file /tmp/.kakao-pw
```

The `--password-file` flag reads the password from the file and **deletes the file immediately after reading**. The password never appears in chat, shell history, or process list.

**Step 3: Retry the original command**
After successful auth, immediately execute whatever the user originally asked for.

### Device Slots

KakaoTalk allows these simultaneous sessions:
- **Phone** (always active, never affected by the CLI)
- **PC** — will kick KakaoTalk desktop if the CLI uses this slot
- **Tablet** (default) — safe if you don't use a tablet for KakaoTalk

```bash
# Default: tablet slot (safe for most users)
agent-kakaotalk auth login

# Use PC slot instead (kicks desktop app)
agent-kakaotalk auth login --device-type pc

# Force login even if slot is occupied
agent-kakaotalk auth login --device-type tablet --force
```

## Multi-Account

KakaoTalk supports multiple accounts. Each login stores credentials separately, keyed by user ID.

### Listing Accounts

```bash
agent-kakaotalk auth list
agent-kakaotalk auth list --pretty
```

### Switching Accounts

```bash
agent-kakaotalk auth use <account-id>
```

### Using a Specific Account

All data commands accept `--account <id>` to use a specific account without switching the default:

```bash
agent-kakaotalk chat list --account 1234567890
agent-kakaotalk message list <chat-id> --account 1234567890
agent-kakaotalk message send <chat-id> "Hello" --account 1234567890
```

Without `--account`, commands use the current (default) account.

## Memory

The agent maintains a `~/.config/agent-messenger/MEMORY.md` file as persistent memory across sessions. This is agent-managed — the CLI does not read or write this file. Use the `Read` and `Write` tools to manage your memory file.

### Reading Memory

At the **start of every task**, read `~/.config/agent-messenger/MEMORY.md` using the `Read` tool to load any previously discovered chat IDs, friend names, and preferences.

- If the file doesn't exist yet, that's fine — proceed without it and create it when you first have useful information to store.
- If the file can't be read (permissions, missing directory), proceed without memory — don't error out.

### Writing Memory

After discovering useful information, update `~/.config/agent-messenger/MEMORY.md` using the `Write` tool. Write triggers include:

- After discovering chat IDs and participant names (from `chat list`)
- After discovering your own user ID (from `auth status`)
- After the user gives you an alias or preference ("call this the work chat", "my group chat with Alice is X")
- After discovering chat structure (group chats, 1:1 chats)

When writing, include the **complete file content** — the `Write` tool overwrites the entire file.

### What to Store

- Chat IDs with participant names or display names
- Your own user ID
- User-given aliases ("work chat", "family group")
- Commonly referenced chat IDs
- Any user preference expressed during interaction

### What NOT to Store

Never store tokens, passwords, credentials, or any sensitive data. Never store full message content (just IDs and chat context). Never store OAuth tokens or device UUIDs.

### Handling Stale Data

If a memorized chat ID returns an error, remove it from `MEMORY.md`. Don't blindly trust memorized data — verify when something seems off. Prefer re-listing over using a memorized ID that might be stale.

### Format / Example

```markdown
# Agent Messenger Memory

## KakaoTalk Account

- User ID: `1234567890`
- Device type: tablet

## Chat Rooms

- `9876543210` — Work group chat (Alice, Bob, Charlie)
- `1111111111` — 1:1 with Alice
- `2222222222` — Family group

## Aliases

- "work" → `9876543210` (Work group chat)
- "alice" → `1111111111` (1:1 with Alice)

## Notes

- User prefers --pretty output
- Work chat is the most frequently used
```

> Memory lets you skip repeated `chat list` calls. When you already know a chat ID from a previous session, use it directly.

## Commands

### Auth Commands

```bash
# Login as sub-device (recommended)
agent-kakaotalk auth login
agent-kakaotalk auth login --email <email> --password <password>
agent-kakaotalk auth login --device-type pc --force
agent-kakaotalk auth login --debug

# Check auth status
agent-kakaotalk auth status

# Remove stored credentials
agent-kakaotalk auth logout
agent-kakaotalk auth logout --account <account-id>

# List all stored accounts
agent-kakaotalk auth list
agent-kakaotalk auth list --pretty

# Switch the current account
agent-kakaotalk auth use <account-id>

# Check status of specific account
agent-kakaotalk auth status --account <account-id>

# Remove specific account
agent-kakaotalk auth logout --account <account-id>
```

### Whoami Command

```bash
# Show current authenticated user
agent-kakaotalk whoami
agent-kakaotalk whoami --pretty
agent-kakaotalk whoami --account <account-id>
```

Output includes:
- `user_id` — your KakaoTalk user ID
- `nickname` — your display name
- `profile_image_url` — profile image thumbnail URL
- `original_profile_image_url` — original profile image URL
- `status_message` — your status message
- `account_display_id` — your KakaoTalk ID (may be null if not set)
- `background_image_url` — background image URL
- `original_background_image_url` — original background image URL
- `fullname` — real name (may be null)
- `account_email` — account email (may be null)
- `pstn_number` — phone number (may be null)
- `email_verified` — whether email is verified (may be null)

### Chat Commands

```bash
# List all chat rooms (sorted by most recent activity)
agent-kakaotalk chat list
agent-kakaotalk chat list --pretty
agent-kakaotalk chat list --account <account-id>
agent-kakaotalk chat list --account <account-id> --pretty

# Resolve user-set room titles via CHATINFO (one extra LOCO call per chat;
# slower, but matches the room name shown in the official KakaoTalk app)
agent-kakaotalk chat list --resolve-titles
```

Output includes:
- `chat_id` — numeric chat room ID
- `type` — chat type (1:1, group, open chat)
- `display_name` — comma-separated member names
- `title` — user-set room title (only populated with `--resolve-titles`; otherwise `null`). For open chats (`OM` / `OD`) without a user-set title, falls back to the OpenLink room name (one extra `INFOLINK` LOCO call per such chat).
- `active_members` — number of active members
- `unread_count` — unread message count
- `last_message` — most recent message preview, including `author_name` when the sender's nickname is known from the chat list (otherwise `null`)

### Chat Leave

```bash
# Leave a chat room (works on 1:1, group, open, and PlusChat rooms)
agent-kakaotalk chat leave <chat-id>
agent-kakaotalk chat leave <chat-id> --pretty
agent-kakaotalk chat leave <chat-id> --account <account-id>
```

Output (JSON by default; `--pretty` pretty-prints the same JSON):

```json
{ "success": true, "status_code": 0, "chat_id": "9876543210" }
```

The process exits non-zero when `success` is `false`.

### Member Commands

```bash
# List all members of a chat room (uses LOCO GETMEM — one call per invocation)
agent-kakaotalk member list <chat-id>
agent-kakaotalk member list <chat-id> --pretty
agent-kakaotalk member list <chat-id> --account <account-id>
```

Each member includes:
- `user_id` — numeric user ID (string for safety)
- `nickname` — display name in this chat (open chats may differ from the user's main Kakao nickname)
- `profile_image_url`, `full_profile_image_url`, `original_profile_image_url`
- `status_message`, `country_iso`
- `user_type` — KakaoTalk's user type (100 = friend, 1000 = open profile, etc.); `null` when the server omits the field
- `open_token`, `open_profile_link_id`, `open_permission` — open-chat-only fields (`null` for normal chats; `open_permission` is 1=OWNER, 2=NONE, 4=MANAGER, 8=BOT)

> **SDK-only**: `KakaoTalkClient.getMembersByIds(chatId, userIds)` is available for the >100-member case where you already have specific user IDs to resolve (typically from a CHATONROOM `mi` array). It is intentionally not exposed via the CLI because acquiring those IDs requires a CHATONROOM call that is also SDK-only. Use `agent-kakaotalk member list` for the common case.

### Message Commands

```bash
# List messages in a chat room
agent-kakaotalk message list <chat-id>
agent-kakaotalk message list <chat-id> -n 50
agent-kakaotalk message list <chat-id> --from <log-id>
agent-kakaotalk message list <chat-id> --pretty

# Send a text message
agent-kakaotalk message send <chat-id> "Hello world"
agent-kakaotalk message send <chat-id> "Hello world" --pretty

# Send a quoted reply to a specific message (use a log_id from `message list`)
agent-kakaotalk message send <chat-id> "Replying to this" --reply-to <log-id>

# Edit one of your text messages by log ID
agent-kakaotalk message edit <chat-id> <log-id> "Updated text"

# Send a file (auto-routes by MIME: photo / video / audio / generic file)
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./photo.jpg
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./clip.mp4
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./voice.m4a
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./report.pdf

# Send a multi-photo gallery (2+ images in one message)
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./img1.jpg ./img2.jpg ./img3.jpg

# Force a specific kind (override auto-routing)
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./clip.mp4 --as file       # send as generic file, not video
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./image --as photo         # extension-less file
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./data.bin --mime application/octet-stream

# Mark messages as read up to a given log ID
agent-kakaotalk message mark-read <chat-id> <log-id>
agent-kakaotalk message mark-read <chat-id> <log-id> --pretty
agent-kakaotalk message mark-read <chat-id> <log-id> --link-id <li>   # open chats only

# Use a specific account
agent-kakaotalk message list <chat-id> --account <account-id>
agent-kakaotalk message send <chat-id> "Hello" --account <account-id>
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./photo.jpg --account <account-id>
agent-kakaotalk message edit <chat-id> <log-id> "Updated text" --account <account-id>
agent-kakaotalk message mark-read <chat-id> <log-id> --account <account-id>
```

#### Replying to a Message

`--reply-to <log-id>` sends the text as a quoted reply that references an existing message. Get the `log_id` from `message list` output. The CLI looks up the target in the chat's recent history (latest 100 messages) to build the quote, so the target must be reasonably recent.

```bash
# Find the message you want to reply to
agent-kakaotalk message list <chat-id> -n 50

# Reply to it by its log_id
agent-kakaotalk message send <chat-id> "Good point!" --reply-to 1234567890
```

If the `log_id` is not found in the latest 100 messages, the command errors out without sending.

#### Editing Messages

`message edit` sends a LOCO `MODIFYMSG` packet for an existing message. Pass
the numeric `log_id` from `message list`; KakaoTalk enforces ownership and
other server-side edit restrictions.

```bash
agent-kakaotalk message edit <chat-id> <log-id> "Updated text"
```

Output (JSON by default; `--pretty` pretty-prints the same JSON):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status_code": 0,
  "chat_id": "9876543210",
  "log_id": "3846830417126748160",
  "message": "Updated text"
}
```

The process exits non-zero when `success` is `false`. Transport failures are
reported as `edit_message_failed`.

#### Sending Attachments

`message upload` sends photos, videos, audio, and arbitrary files to a chat. The CLI sniffs the MIME type from the filename and dispatches to the matching KakaoTalk message type, so the common case is a single command and a file path:

```bash
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./report.pdf
```

Routing rules:

| Filename / MIME | Sent as | KakaoTalk renders it as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image/*` (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) | photo | Inline image with tap-to-zoom |
| `video/*` (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.webm`) | video | Inline player with play button |
| `audio/*` (`.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`) | audio | Voice-message bubble with waveform |
| anything else | file | Generic file attachment with download icon |

Multi-photo galleries (one message that contains several images): pass 2+ files and the CLI uses the gallery flow automatically.

```bash
agent-kakaotalk message upload <chat-id> ./img1.jpg ./img2.jpg ./img3.jpg
```

Override the auto-routing with `--as <photo|video|audio|file|multi>` when you need explicit control — for example, to send an `.mp4` as a generic downloadable file instead of an inline video. Use `--mime <type>` to override MIME detection (handy for extension-less files or when the caller knows better than the filename).

Output (JSON by default; `--pretty` pretty-prints the same JSON):

```json
{ "success": true, "status_code": 0, "chat_id": "9876543210", "log_id": "3846830417126748160", "sent_at": 1779509936 }
```

The process exits non-zero when `success` is `false`.

Notes:
- All attachment kinds use the same SHIP / POST / COMPLETE LOCO pipeline (and MSHIP / MPOST / FORWARD for multi-photo). The server registers the chatlog itself once the upload finishes; no follow-up text message is needed.
- KakaoTalk caps single-message attachment sizes server-side (currently ~300MB for files, ~20MB per image in multi-photo). The CLI surfaces the server's status code on rejection.
- Filenames are preserved on the recipient side for `file` kind, used as a display label for `audio`, and ignored for `photo` / `video` (the client renders the bytes directly).
- Each upload opens one fresh TCP+LOCO connection per attachment. Multi-photo opens N connections in parallel.

#### Mark as Read

`message mark-read` sends a LOCO `NOTIREAD` packet to advance the server-side read watermark for a chat. The watermark is a `log_id` — typically the latest message's `log_id` from `message list` — not a timestamp.

Output (JSON by default; `--pretty` pretty-prints the same JSON):

```json
{ "success": true, "status_code": 0, "chat_id": "9876543210", "watermark": "123456789" }
```

The process exits non-zero when `success` is `false` so shell scripts can branch on it.

Notes:
- Caller-driven and explicit — there is no auto-mark-on-receive behavior. Blind acking incoming messages would be a distinct behavioral fingerprint against an undocumented protocol and is intentionally out of scope.
- Observed in testing on a sub-device tablet slot (the default `agent-messenger` slot). KakaoTalk does not support third-party clients; server behavior may vary by chat type, account region, or client version. Use sparingly; avoid tight loops.
- The phone's home-screen OS unread badge may lag until the phone client foregrounds; the in-app counter updates faster. Observed quirk, not a guaranteed contract.
- For open chats (오픈채팅) pass `--link-id <li>` (the `li` field on the open chat). Without it the server returns a non-zero `body.status`, which the CLI reports as `"success": false` with the server's status code, and exits non-zero.

#### Message List Output

Each message includes:
- `log_id` — unique message identifier
- `type` — message type (1 = text, 2 = photo, 3 = video, 5 = audio, 12 = sticker, 18 = file, 20 = animated sticker, 27 = multi-photo, etc.)
- `author_id` — sender's user ID
- `author_name` — sender's nickname when known from the chat list (otherwise `null`; only the room's "display members" are cached)
- `message` — message text content (empty string for non-text messages like stickers)
- `attachment` — parsed JSON metadata for non-text messages (e.g. photo URL/dimensions, sticker path), or `null` for plain text. Shape varies by `type`; treat as an opaque object and narrow per message type.
- `sent_at` — Unix timestamp (milliseconds)

#### Fetching More Messages

The CLI handles internal pagination automatically. Just increase `-n` to get more messages. Pagination is capped at ~4,000 raw messages (50 pages × 80 per page). If the cap is hit, a warning is printed to stderr and results may be incomplete.

```bash
# Get latest 20 messages (default)
agent-kakaotalk message list 9876543210

# Get 50 messages
agent-kakaotalk message list 9876543210 -n 50

# Get 200 messages
agent-kakaotalk message list 9876543210 -n 200

# Get messages newer than a known log ID (forward only)
agent-kakaotalk message list 9876543210 --from 123456789
```

## Output Format

### JSON (Default)

All commands output JSON by default for AI consumption:

```json
{
  "chat_id": "9876543210",
  "type": 2,
  "display_name": "Alice, Bob",
  "title": null,
  "active_members": 3,
  "unread_count": 5,
  "last_message": {
    "author_id": 1111111111,
    "author_name": "Alice",
    "message": "Hello everyone!",
    "sent_at": 1705312200000
  }
}
```

### Pretty (Human-Readable)

Use `--pretty` flag for formatted output:

```bash
agent-kakaotalk chat list --pretty
```

## Global Options

| Option      | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--account` | Use a specific KakaoTalk account (default: current account)  |
| `--pretty`  | Human-readable output instead of JSON                        |

## Common Patterns

See `references/common-patterns.md` for typical AI agent workflows.

## Templates

See `templates/` directory for runnable examples:

- `post-message.sh` - Send messages with error handling
- `monitor-chat.sh` - Monitor a chat for new messages
- `chat-summary.sh` - Generate chat summary

## Error Handling

All commands return consistent error format:

```json
{
  "error": "No KakaoTalk credentials found. Run:\n  agent-kakaotalk auth login     (recommended — registers as sub-device, desktop app stays running)"
}
```

Common errors:

- `No KakaoTalk credentials found` — not authenticated. Run `auth login`.
- `bad_credentials` — wrong email or password. Cached credentials from the desktop app may be stale. Ask the user to provide credentials manually with `--email` and `--password`.
- `login_failed` — device slot conflict or unknown login error. Run with `--debug` for the full server response.
- `passcode_request_failed` — failed to request device verification code.
- `registration_timeout` — passcode expired before user confirmed on phone.
- `login_http_error` — network issue reaching KakaoTalk servers.
- `LOCO packet timeout` — messaging protocol timed out (server may be overloaded).

## Configuration

Credentials stored in `~/.config/agent-messenger/kakaotalk-credentials.json` (0600 permissions). See [references/authentication.md](references/authentication.md) for format and security details.

Config format:

```json
{
  "current_account": "1234567890",
  "accounts": {
    "1234567890": {
      "account_id": "1234567890",
      "oauth_token": "...",
      "user_id": "1234567890",
      "refresh_token": "...",
      "device_uuid": "...",
      "device_type": "tablet",
      "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## SDK: Programmatic Usage

`KakaoTalkClient` is available as a TypeScript SDK for building scripts and automations.

### Setup

```typescript
import { KakaoTalkClient } from 'agent-messenger/kakaotalk'

const client = await new KakaoTalkClient().login()
```

Or with manual credential management:

```typescript
import { KakaoTalkClient, KakaoCredentialManager } from 'agent-messenger/kakaotalk'

const manager = new KakaoCredentialManager()
const account = await manager.getAccount()
if (!account) throw new Error('Not authenticated')

const client = await new KakaoTalkClient().login({ oauthToken: account.oauth_token, userId: account.user_id, deviceUuid: account.device_uuid })
```

For caller-managed token renewal, use the explicit SDK primitive:

```typescript
import { refreshKakaoOAuthToken } from 'agent-messenger/kakaotalk'

if (!account.refresh_token) throw new Error('No KakaoTalk refresh token')

const refreshed = await refreshKakaoOAuthToken({
  accessToken: account.oauth_token,
  refreshToken: account.refresh_token,
  deviceUuid: account.device_uuid,
})

const nextAccount = {
  ...account,
  oauth_token: refreshed.accessToken,
  refresh_token: refreshed.refreshToken,
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
}

// Persist nextAccount atomically before another client uses this credential.
// The refresh primitive intentionally does not write credential files or retry login.
```

Kakao can rotate the refresh token. Never refresh a copied production credential and discard the returned token set. See [references/authentication.md](references/authentication.md) for error codes and the controlled canary procedure.

### Example

```typescript
try {
  // Get your profile
  const profile = await client.getProfile()

  // List chats
  const chats = await client.getChats()

  // Send a message
  if (chats.length === 0) throw new Error('No chats found')
  const chatId = chats[0].chat_id
  const result = await client.sendMessage(chatId, 'Hello from SDK!')

  // Edit the text message by its returned log_id
  await client.editMessage(chatId, result.log_id, 'Updated text')

  // Send a file (photo / video / audio / file auto-routed by MIME). Pass
  // an array to send several at once — all-image arrays become a gallery.
  const photo = await Bun.file('./photo.jpg').bytes()
  await client.sendAttachment(chatId, photo, 'photo.jpg')

  // Read messages
  const messages = await client.getMessages(chatId, { count: 50 })

  // Reply to a message by quoting it
  const target = messages[messages.length - 1]
  await client.sendMessage(chatId, 'Replying to your last message', {
    replyTo: { log_id: target.log_id, author_id: target.author_id, message: target.message, type: target.type },
  })
} finally {
  // Always close when done (LOCO TCP connection)
  client.close()
}
```

## Limitations

- Auto-extraction of email/password from the desktop app is **macOS and Windows only** (KakaoTalk desktop is not available on Linux). Linux users must pass `--email` and `--password` (or `--password-file`) explicitly — the LOCO protocol, login flow, and all messaging features work on Linux.
- No chat room creation
- No friend list management
- No reactions or emoji
- No message editing or deletion
- No open chat (오픈채팅) browsing or joining
- No search across chats
- Stickers / emoticons cannot be sent (inbound stickers expose pack/path metadata, but the sticker store requires desktop-app purchase flows the SDK does not replicate). Photos, videos, audio, and arbitrary files can both be received and sent — see [`message upload`](#message-commands) and [`KakaoTalkClient.sendAttachment`](#sdk-programmatic-usage).
- Chat IDs are numeric and not human-readable — use `chat list` to discover them

## Troubleshooting

### `agent-kakaotalk: command not found`

**`agent-kakaotalk` is NOT the npm package name.** The npm package is `agent-messenger`.

If the package is installed globally, use `agent-kakaotalk` directly:

```bash
agent-kakaotalk chat list --pretty
```

If the package is NOT installed, use `--package` to install and run:

```bash
npx -y --package agent-messenger agent-kakaotalk chat list --pretty
bunx --package agent-messenger agent-kakaotalk chat list --pretty
pnpm dlx --package agent-messenger agent-kakaotalk chat list --pretty
```

> **Note**: If the user prefers a different package runner, use the matching command above.

**NEVER run `npx agent-kakaotalk`, `bunx agent-kakaotalk`, or `pnpm dlx agent-kakaotalk`** without `--package agent-messenger`. It will fail or install a wrong package since `agent-kakaotalk` is not the npm package name.

### Password prompt on fresh install

On fresh installs, the desktop app (macOS or Windows) may hash or omit the password from its cache, so the CLI cannot extract it automatically. The CLI will prompt for the password once to register the device — via a native dialog on macOS (AppKit), Windows (PowerShell WinForms), or Linux (`zenity` / `kdialog`), or via a TTY prompt if a terminal is available. After registration, the password is never needed again.

On Linux there is no desktop app to extract from, so always provide credentials explicitly:

```bash
agent-kakaotalk auth login --email user@example.com --password-file /tmp/.kakao-pw
```

`--password-file` reads the file then immediately deletes it, so the password never appears in shell history or process listings.

When the CLI returns `{"next_action": "run_interactive", ...}`, use a tmux session to let the user type their password securely. See "Handling `run_interactive`" above for the exact steps.

**NEVER** ask for the password in chat or pass it via `--password` — this exposes the plaintext password in conversation logs, shell history, and process lists.

### Bad credentials

If login returns `bad_credentials`, the provided password is incorrect. **Do NOT retry with `--force` or switch device slots** — the issue is the credentials themselves, not the device slot.

If the issue persists, run with `--debug` to see the full server response.

### Device slot occupied

If login fails because the tablet slot is occupied (error: `login_failed`, not `bad_credentials`):

```bash
# Option 1: Use the PC slot instead
agent-kakaotalk auth login --device-type pc --force

# Option 2: Force the tablet slot (kicks existing tablet session)
agent-kakaotalk auth login --device-type tablet --force
```

### Passcode verification timeout

If the passcode expires before you confirm on your phone:

1. Run `agent-kakaotalk auth login` again — a new passcode will be generated
2. Confirm the code on your phone within the time limit
3. The CLI automatically completes login after confirmation
