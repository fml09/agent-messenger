# Third-Party Notices

This KakaoTalk protocol and Android authentication implementation was written
from scratch for agent-messenger. The protocol knowledge used to build it comes
from the following open-source projects and their documentation. No code was
copied from these projects.

Primary protocol reference for: current encryption parameters (AES-128-GCM,
key_encrypt_type=16, encrypt_type=3), RSA public key (PKCS#1, e=3), connection
flow (Booking → Checkin → Login), packet structure, LOCO command reference,
macOS credential extraction approach, and LOGINLIST field schema.

## openkakao-cli reaction probing

Its March 2026 probe discovered the `ACTION` reaction request and the
`SYNCACTION` push. The request shape is `{ chatId, logId, type }`, with
`type=1` the only captured reaction type. The push has no add/remove flag, so
reaction removal uses the same `ACTION` state-toggle request only when the
caller owns a confirmed successful add; the SDK does not expose an arbitrary
idempotent remove operation.
